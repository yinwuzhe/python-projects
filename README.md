Hi!
This is a game I will describe in details later, and I will also update it 
with new features, later or now. 
some features like:
1.playing via the web
2.advanced user input(I will use lexicon and try to translate a sentence intelligently)
3.Make the HTML look better
4.logins and create a signup system for the application, so people can have logins and high scores.
5.Give people a "help" system that lets them ask what they can do at each room in the game.
6.Create several "maps" and let people choose a game they want to run. 

Having fun with it and with yourself!
